# Headless Chrome Remote Desktop Setup

## Pre-requisites

Update package lists and install `wget`:

```shell
sudo apt update
sudo apt-get install --assume-yes wget
```

## Install Chromote in remote machine

1. On the remote machine, install chromote:

    ```shell
    wget https://dl.google.com/linux/direct/chrome-remote-desktop_current_amd64.deb
    sudo dpkg --install chrome-remote-desktop_current_amd64.deb
    sudo apt install --assume-yes --fix-broken
    ```

1. Add your user account to the Linux group:

    ```shell
    sudo usermod -a -G chrome-remote-desktop $USER
    ```

1. On your local laptop browser, open <https://remotedesktop.google.com/headless>.
    Then follow the steps to set up another computer. You would probably copy
    the relevant command to your remote shell, similar to this:

    ```shell
    DISPLAY= /opt/google/chrome-remote-desktop/start-host \
        --code="4/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx" \
        --redirect-url="https://remotedesktop.google.com/_/oauthredirect" \
        --name=
    ```

to install a desktop GUI environment in the remote linux machine..

Additional steps for it are:

1. Install Xfce as it performs the best without fancy animations over a slow network.

    ```shell
    sudo DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt install --assume-yes xfce4 desktop-
    ```

1. Configure Chrome Remote Desktop to use Xfce by default:

    ```shell
    sudo bash -c 'echo "exec /etc/X11/Xsession /usr/bin/xfce4-session" > /etc/chrome-remote-desktop-session'
    ```

1. Install xscreensaver as an alternative to the default Xfce locker, which doesnâ€™t work with remote desktop:

    ```shell
    sudo apt install --assume-yes xscreensaver
    ```

1. Disable display manager as there is no display connected:

    ```shell
    sudo systemctl disable lightdm.service
    ```

### Install chrome browser

```shell
wget https://dl.google.com/linux/direct/google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb
```
