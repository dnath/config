# Vim Setup

## Installation

For macOS, use `brew` to install `vim` as per the instructions [here](/doc/brew_setup.md#install-brew).

## Customize `vim`

After the dotfiles installation is complete, customize `vim`:

1. Install `Vundle` by opening `vim` and running `:PluginInstall`.

   > Alternatively, from command line, run: `vim +PluginInstall +qall`
